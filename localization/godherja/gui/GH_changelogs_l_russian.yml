the former Redlander faiths will be reused in the future when we implement cult mechanics around the world\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Instead of Piety, Redlanders have ‘Favor’\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ Redlanders have greatly reduced monthly Favor gain, and instead have to complete missions to receive it\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Missions are given to you from your Dark Gods through the ‘Commune with Shadows’ decision\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Failing missions or taking too long to do them can result in a huge loss of Favor or various other punishments, up to and including death or excommunication (leading to every other Redlander dogpiling you)\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ In return, the higher your ‘Level of Submission’ (in place of Levels of Devotion), the higher Blackspawn trait you can receive\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ Having high Favor can upgrade your new Blackspawn trait\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ The Blackspawn trait gives greatly improved magical abilities and can extend your life longer and longer - the highest levels can make you functionally immortal\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ You also lose fertility and the ability to feel or think independently, and displeasing your gods at higher levels when you’re directly interlinked with them can cause disastrous effects\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Redlanders can not create Duchies or higher titles outside of some specific Decisions and other effects and are normally locked to the County level, and can also not recruit normal Men at Arms whatsoever\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ In return for this, you get extremely powerful Men at Arms that only cost Favor, as well as exceptionally powerful dark magics to wield\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Redlanders send their children off to the Black Pits to be trained and twisted in secret by dark beings, in return they can freely designate heirs and care little about dynastic continuance\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Redlanders do not grow beards and do not visibly age\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Redlanders have a unique ‘Absolution of the Void’ magic school\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ New Dark Raid spell increases raid movement speed and raid speed in exchange for human sacrifice\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ New ‘Call of the Void’ religious tenet that enable most of the above feature, and gives you bonuses to your Dark aspect\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ Also gives increased bonuses to sacrificing characters\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Redlanders now have unique occultic holdings\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Redlanders can construct the following buildings, upgrading one all the way will grant you a huge amount of favor and powerful MAA, but destroy the building in the process\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ Dark Obelisk\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ Hall of Abnegation\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ Black Pits\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ New title history for several different provinces in the Redlands\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ New Redlander historical characters\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Redrunners\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Changed Cultural Traditions\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ Now have Legacy of Aversaria, Isolationist and Centralized\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ Also have the new ‘Hives of Scum and Villainy’ Cultural Tradition\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Give big bonuses to your income and greatly improves metro holdings\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Also allows you to Isolate your capital and Seclude your family at will\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ You even get several bonuses for doing this and gain the ‘Purge Capital’ decision - letting you burn the city around your fortress and hopefully clear out any local cult or beast infestations (and bitchy peasants) in return for greatly damaging the province\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_SIX$ This is helpful because being in the Redlands means you’re constantly at risk of getting some extremely nasty events - the trade route you sit on is stupidly lucrative and you’re the only one willing to manage it (hence the name), but attrition will be high\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ It also gives scaling bonuses to both Tyranny and Dread and bonuses for having both - rule like the Hive City nobility you were inspired by!\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Redrunners can also perform mass purges of their courts if they worry about infiltration from the Redlanders\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ And you can freely execute and torture commoners\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Starting Situation\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Everyone who isn’t a Redlander begins the game in crisis. Redlanders, their beasts and their cults are overwhelming the crisis-stricken Redrunner trade cities, those not directly attacked being destroyed in devastating rituals or being infiltrated and torn down from the inside by Redlander agents. The Redrunners are fleeing en masse, evacuating to the Red Isles or further to escape the fury. The Redlanders seem to be searching for something, and we can only hope they do not find it…\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Non-cultist armies can now be ambushed by the horrific beasts that emerge from the red sands\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ New Casus Bellis for Redlanders, Redrunners, and anyone else who is in the Redlands\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ Redlander CBs\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Redlanders can raid over land regardless of their government\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Redlanders have a CB to conquer any neighboring County to drain it for resources. After conquering it, the County will be continually drained of Development and other resources and gain increasing amount of negative Modifiers until the province becomes a Ruins-filled Wasteland and you can abandon it. This can be used to create a buffer between the Redlands and the outside world\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ If the province is in the Redlands you can also choose to occupy, give away, or Wasteland it for varied rewards\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ Foreigner and Redrunner CBs\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Non-Redlanders that neighbor them (or are connected via the sea) can take a special CB to purge them out and destroy them, but other Redlanders can join as allies\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ This turns the province to Wasteland, possibly giving you goodies as you loot the eldritch cult hideouts of the Redlanders, but you’ll need to (re)colonize the province if you wish to actually secure it\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ If all Redlander titles are destroyed, you can take the ‘Reintegrate the Redlands’ decision to bring the region back under de jure Aironoi (or the local empire if Aironoi has been disbanded) for a bunch of nice boosts, a slightly safer Redlands, and the permanent (for now…) removal of the accursed Redlanders\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Characters can also take the ‘Redlands Evacuation’ Casus Belli - this is similar to the Varangian Adventure CB with some twists\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ If you are located on the Redlands Coast, it will be extremely expensive to escape out of the Redlands entirely, but it’ll be very cheap to instead invade into the Redland Isles where the local authorities and the incompetent son of the now-sacrificed former Magistrate are actively collapsing\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ If you are located in the Redland Isles, it’ll be much cheaper to flee elsewhere\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ While not part of the CB itself, if you (or your courtiers) have family or friends back in the Imperial core, they may offer you a holding to move to so you can abandon your subjects for greener pastures\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_SIX$ Likewise, you will get continuous events for characters trying to flee your court and local citizens likewise attempting to take flight - you can forbid this and attempt to crack down on this, but this can lead to a civil war or they may just try fighting their way to the port and stealing your boats anyway.\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_SIX$ Fleeing citizens and courtiers will greatly diminish the amount of Event Troops and other boosts for your escape attempt!\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ The AI is extremely encouraged to try to do this, so enjoy the scramble as you and everyone else dogpile the Islands trying to get the hell out of dodge\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ At start, the Redlands interior now begin without any De Jure Empire - in prior startdates this will be triggered by a decision to begin the Redlander purge of the Redrunners (beginning in roughly the 1240s in lore)\n$GH_CHANGELOG_HEADER_CHANGES$\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Map Changes\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Completely redrawn most of the map, the number of baronies and other titles has been greatly reduced, and the map repainted to account for this\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ The Isles especially - from Chevalie to the Pirate Coast - have been redrawn from the ground up with a new design ethos based around depicting scale but making the actual province setup simple and easy to visually distinguish\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Terrain textures have been almost completely replaced with HD ones provided by the Matt from the LOTR team and the AGOT team (as well as many from Quixel) - thanks guys!\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Many Godherja unique ones like the Wastelands have also been redone from scratch to fit the new HD redesign\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ There are also multiple new unique textures for different regions - such as blue sand and teal grass for Iyondel\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Opakhasia greatly opened up with new mountainous provinces in its center instead of an impenetrable barrier\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Amsar likewise greatly opened up -

Instead, it is capped by your aspect-specific spellcasting skill, which can theoretically and practically be much higher than 3 if you’re a skilled Magi\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ All spells have been restructured to take into account that they may be casted at much higher levels than 3. The player should be able to overcharge every spell all the way to level 10 and possibly even more and still see scaling benefits\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Spell resistance and backfire changes\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Resisting a spell is now a distinct thing from the spell backfiring.

Trying to get them to cast a hostile spell on their child, for example, is unlikely to work\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ The ‘Generate Magic’ job has also been removed — instead, it now boosts your Extended Magic Baseline based on the ability of your Court Magi\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ System of magic ingredients\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Ingredients modify base effects of spells they are used with, allowing for a greater range of spell effects\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Currently, only a few effects use ingredients, but they will be successively added to existing and new spells\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ System of magic components\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Artifacts, prisoners, and other notable courtiers can occasionally be inserted into a spell for added benefits when casting the spell or from its effects\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ AI & Magic\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ The AI will now use magic, with support of their Court Magi if needed, in accordance with their traits\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ New Magic Schools\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Rather than having the old split of Mixed magic, Life magic and Death magic schools.

have unlocked at game start or can acquire through decisions\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ The generic bloodline traits have been replaced with dynasty modifiers\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Legalism should now be hidden for people who cannot use it\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Some perks of Magic Legacy were renamed for consistency with vanilla Legacies\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Magi Court\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Kings and Emperors can now have Magi Courts, granting cheaper Magi recruitment, more Magi regiments, better

of the Kidunawa\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Kyaalism\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Court Magi position should no longer be restricted by gender\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ This should also fix the problem with ‘Search for Magi’ decision generating candidates ineligible for Court Magi councillor position\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Character name changes\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Cristoff to Chrysé\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Eoghar-Argeadh Mereyngraed to Eoghar-Argaidh Armhoragh\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Every

list to remove names of Islamic origin\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Men at Arms rebalance\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Godherja’s unique Men at Arms types have been rebalanced to each fill a unique role or add their own considerations to warfare and army management\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Almost all Men at Arms now have various bonuses or maluses in Underground terrain, scaling higher from Chambers (relatively the most open areas) to Corridors to Caverns (the most dangerous for units poorly equipped Underground, and the most advantageous otherwise)\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ All Units\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ All infantry melee units now get a bump to Pursuit and Screen in Underground terrain - even those who have zero otherwise. This means that it can be much harder to find decisive victory in the underworld, as fleeing soldiers have plenty of places to hide and regroup\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Archers do not get the Pursuit bonus but get do get the bonus to Screen\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ All units with bonuses to Plains, Drylands or Deserts now get similar bonuses in Deadlands depending on the unit (and likewise had Drylands and Plains added wherever only one was present)\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Specialist Units\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ Adventurers\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ A new unit type, Adventurers perform poorly in traditional warfare and their mediocre stats combined with their small unit size and high cost means you will likely not be fielding much of an army with them\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ You will, however, want to always keep at least a stack of them with your army. Adventurers have extremely powerful counters to Monster units with lesser counters to Magical, Construct, Flying, Magi and Undead units and while they flounder against more disciplined soldiers they can easily take on most Monsters when backed up by trained soldiers\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Their only real saving grace in direct stats is high Toughness - necessary for them to survive long enough to take out high Damage Monsters\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Adventurers also get some bonuses in rough terrain like Hills, Mountains, Jungles and Forests where their guerilla tactics are far more useful and, uniquely, get massive bonuses in abnormal terrain like the Underground and Deadlands where they can be extremely dangerous even to more traditional soldiers or the natives\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ Construct\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ Flying\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ Undead\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ Magi\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ Magical\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ Monsters\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Normal Units\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ Archers\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Archers now get big debuffs to their Damage in Underground terrain and don’t receive any Pursuit benefits there that other units receive\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ Crossbowmen are still debuffed in the Underground but less-so than other Archer units and can still prove dangerous\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Archers have a very light counter against Monsters and Magi with a far more substantial one (though lesser than Magi) against Flying units\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ Chariot Cavalry\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ A new ‘mundane’ unit type with previous chariot units like the Vhanavid special being placed under it\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Chariots are the hyperfocused cocaine-addicted abandoned cousin of cavalry\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Chariots are far less susceptible to Pikemen and have strong Counters against almost all infantry\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ They also have much higher base Toughness than normal cavalry and equivalent Screen, allowing them to survive battles in terrain not suited to them…\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ … which is basically everywhere. Chariots in flatlands are a terror and can absolutely ruin the lives of squishy feet-lubbers like an angry wall with horses or whatever horrifying monstrosities are being used with Damage only outmatched by Elephants (for mundane units), but in all other terrain they will lose almost all ability to effectively fight\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ While somewhat serviceable in Forest and Hills, Chariots in Mountains, Jungles, Wetlands, Taiga, and good god the Underground are even more screwed than regular Cavalry\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ While Chariots have a decent Pursuit value that is likewise bumped up in flatlands, they have no real ability to Screen\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ They are also pound-for-pound far more expensive than Cavalry and come in stacks of 25, half that of Heavy Cavalry. They will shine the further you go back in time, especially as bookmarks are introduced, but the growth of cheap cavalry means that they are incredibly situational\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ On the bright side, special versions of Chariot Cavalry often come with various benefits to potentially offset this\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ Cavalry\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Normal Cavalry (and especially Elephants) are now almost useless in Underground terrain and should avoid it at all costs - they lose their Pursuit and Screen like in Wetlands but have an even higher malus to their Damage and Toughness than any other terrain\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Consider not ordering your elite riders to perform a glorious charge from within a hole\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ Light Footmen\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Skirmishers get a big bonus to their Pursuit and Screen values in the Underground and uniquely for regular MAA get lesser ones to Damage and Toughness, making them exceptionally dangerous in the underdark\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Sjalvolki Berserkers\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ Berserkers have a decent counter against Monsters and a lesser one against the Undead, along with a small one against Magical units. They also have a smaller counter against Pikemen whose formations are shattered by the maddened warriors and Skirmishers who are but lambs to the slaughter\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ Berserkers excel in the Underground where their enemies have nowhere to run and the Forests where the Sjalvolki generally excel\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ However they now have far lower Toughness, compensated by a big boost to their Damage - nearly double that of the next highest Infantry unit, along with a stack size boost up to 100 to be in line with most other units. They’re also fairly cheaper than they were previously\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ They have also had their insanely high Pursuit stat lowered - no amount of hallucinogenic mushrooms can make you run twice as fast as the average horse, sadly. They’ve also lost their Screen bonus meaning that they will take extreme losses if things go south\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ Berserkers also don’t have the Screen bonus other units get in the Underground - nobody runs to Velos, they fall to the Gods Below from there they STAND!\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Moonkin\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ Warriors beneath Aervalr’s light and masters of the Eight fighting styles, the Moonkin generally work as ritual keepers and stewards but beneath the cover of darkness hunt and destroy those who threaten the Mondecny tribes\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ While their Toughness is roughly equivalent to generic Skirmishers and their preferences for peace lowers their Damage, they have a very hefty Pursuit and Screen bonus, making them adept at hunting down fleeing enemies or protecting their kin during retreat\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ They receive bonuses to their Damage and Toughness within Hill terrain and a further boost to their Pursuit and Screen. They’re also exceptional in the Underground, the shadows providing their ideal concealment\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ However they fair much poorly when exposed, and are greatly degraded in Plains and other open terrain\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Wodes\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ Maddened Fogeater tribesmen have been a thing of dark myth and rumor for decades, but now as the Fog reaches the south the entirety of the north now screams and cries from beneath its shroud. While the Talaregs may have been the first Fogeaters, specimens are now found with Legion tattoos, Ölteni masks and Kathuni clothing, and all now swarm as One towards unknown and dark purpose\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ Fogeaters are scary. They fight to kill their foes with no regard for their own safety, and Fogeaters have been seen cleaved nearly in half and still desperately crawling towards their target in a frenzied rage. Fogeaters have no Screen, but have extremely high Pursuit, Toughness and Damage for Skirmishers - their direct combat stats surpassing Armored Footmen\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ They further excel in Forested terrain, but unlike most units they do not receive terrain bonuses in the Anti-Magic equivalents - The few Fogeaters brought back by the remains of mercenaries escaping the Fog who didn’t manage to kill themselves on the way to Chevalie have all seemed to grow melancholic and distant beneath the Shield, as if the Voices they scream of are now distant and muffled\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ The primitive and scavenged weapons of the Fogeaters often struggle to break proper armor, and Wodes do not receive the traditional Counter against Heavy Infantry that other Skirmishers enjoy…\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ … but anything squishy enough is going to have a really bad time. Wodes have a strong Counter against other Skirmishers, and a lesser one against Light Cavalry and Monsters\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ The sight of human Magi seems to infuriate them as well - those few Aversarian Magi who survived both the exodus south and an encounter with the Fogeaters have often recounted the wretched screeching from the Fogeaters whenever they used the Gift, the screams somehow echoing deep within them in places that even they can not reach. Wodes have a hard counter against Magi equivalent to their Skirmisher counter\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ As if this wasn’t bad enough they’re nearly free for Fogeaters to hire and maintain - only costing some Prestige and Piety - and come in stacks of 150\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ Fuck around and find out\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Bloodbound\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ Eager Iyrossi warriors sworn to vengeance against the wretched Aversarians for their centuries of humiliation and cruelty, let every Grudge be answered by the Dawrossi!\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ The warrior cult of the Deiphartoros do not have the modern equipment, the centuries of experience or the military discipline of other soldiers, but they make up for this in their zealous demand for gore-soaked vengeance!\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ Bloodbound have pathetic Toughness and effectively no Screen and will likely take heavy losses in most battles. They will give as well as they take however with high Damage for skirmishers and an extremely high Pursuit value to help them hunt down every last evil slaver who is running away saying dumb things like “I’m a civilian” or “I’m only seven years old” despite being stupid idiot slaver pricks\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ Their bitter refusal to retreat also means they forfeit half of the Screen bonus to Underground terrain that other skirmishers enjoy\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ They make up for their weaknesses with their cheap cost - almost half of the normal price of Light Infantry in gold and a small amount of piety - not to mention their impressive counters. Focused on destroying the Aversarians, they are nearly as strong against Magi as Marcher Anti-Magi and are equally formidable against Magical units - their anger somehow even able to tear through the shells of Constructs\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ Likewise the heavy armor of the Malcoisiac Governorial Legions proved little able to resist their fury, and they also carry a very hefty Counter against Heavy Infantry and Heavy Cavalry\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ Finally the bloodbound are adept at fighting within the Hills and Mountains of Malcois, getting a modest bonus there, but taking an equal penalty when venturing out into flatlands like Plains. Uniquely, they get their a massive bonus to to Damage and Pursuit while battling through Farmlands and Floodplains - more developed areas with many slavers waiting to be liberated of their wretched lives, these places are where the Bloodbound shall force the Aversarians to truly know just a drop of the horrors they themselves once wrought\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Huntsmen\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ Kardweni Huntsmen might seem to have poor stats for Skirmishers, but their impressive amount of counters against other infantry and their extremely high Pursuit in rough terrain makes them extremely dangerous to be on the losing side of. Try not to lose your head!\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Kan'pahuri\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ Kan'pahuri - experts of each step of the dance of the Sevra Par and throwers of many axes have extremely high Damage for a Skirmisher, can counter War Machine and Construct type units, and can even tear down the gates of low-tech fortresses and serve as makeshift siege engineers\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ On the flip side, they have poor stats otherwise and only receive half the normal counter against Heavy Infantry\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Legion Marines\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ The saltiest soldiers in Aversaria, the Marine Legions are overlooked despite having perhaps the most impressive combat history of all of old Aversaria’s Legions. Legion Marines are extremely impressive in combat with Damage and Toughness comparable to Heavy Infantry with a Skirmisher’s Pursuit and Screen.\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ Needing to operate independently in the Isles without much hope of mainlanders bothering to supply or pay them, Marine Legionnaires also have the ability to siege and can counter whatever Monsters assault their fleets\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ This is all countered by a steep price like most Legion units and a lack of terrain bonuses. Even more damning, they can only field up to four sub-regiments per unit\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ Pikemen\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Pikemen don’t get the standard infantry Pursuit bonus in Underground terrain but they instead receive a flag boost to Toughness instead while retaining the Screen benefit\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ They also have a (very) small counter to Monsters\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ All Pikemen that didn’t have bonuses against Camel Cavalry and Elephant Cavalry before now also have a Counter to it equivalent to their other cavalry counters\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Pikes of the Purest\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ Pikes of the Purest now have a small counter to Magi and Magical units as well as an increased benefit in Mountains and Hills to reflect the fauna and geography of Opakhasia\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ They also receive a small Damage boost specifically specifically in non-Desert Mountains\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ To offset this they are less effective against Cavalry than other Pikemen, being less used to dealing with them\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Konijkmener Pikes\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ Konijkmener Pikes have been reworked to represent their role as the Republican Militia and urban Night Watch\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ They now have some of the worst base stats of any special unit, having nearly half of the Damage and Toughness of generic Pikemen with only a moderate Screen boost to compensate in direct stats\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ They also perform worse than other Pikemen in Hill, Mountain and Underground terrain and have half the Counter ability against Cavalry to boot\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ However, they make up for all of this by getting big boi bonuses in Wetlands: enough to make them slightly more powerful than generic Pikemen along with a big boost to Pursuit and Screen making them perfect as auxiliaries to professional troops\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ They also have the highest Counter abilities against Monster MAA of any Pikemen unit, along with a small Counter against Magi\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ Finally, they also come in stacks of 250 and are 80% cheaper than generic Pikemen to boot!\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Kaphral and Jokhosani\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ These Pikemen MAA already had anti-Monster before the rework so they’ve had their previous Counter ability added to the new baseline Monster counter that Pikemen get\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Golden Spears\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ The Adabyssians are advanced and their army one of the few professional ones on Aeras - the Golden Spears stand as the pillar of the elite Central Army of the southern empire, the horde of downtrodden auxiliaries dreaming of the day they might bleed enough to be invited into their elite ranks\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ They are, however, factory line troops primarily meant to hold areas and keep enemies busy enough for a giant angry statue to mash the tribal barbarians to a fine paste under several billions dollars weight in gold\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ To reflect this, Golden Spears have twice the recruitment and maintenance of traditional Pikemen and due to their stringent and inflexible training have maluses for rough terrain outside of Mountains and Hills and without the normal benefit Pikemen or other Infantry get in the Underground - instead receiving a hefty malus\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ Their discipline and thick gilded armor gives them a huge bonus to Toughness over other Pikemen, but their Damage is lacking compared to others - the Golden Spears only attack when ordered, and don’t love having to. Dying is the right of the auxiliary. They also receive no Screening bonuses in the Underground, there is nowhere for them to run, for the Empire accepts no retreat\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ Due to their expert formation fighting, they receive benefits in Flatland equivalent to what most Pikemen get in Hills, as well as greater bonuses in Hills and Mountains than the average. They also receive an even more powerful Counter ability against Cavalry than other Pikes\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ Unable to respond quickly to chaotic situations however they will flounder when presented with unpredictable foes like Monsters, not receiving the traditional Pikemen bonus against them and only half of the normal Counter against Elephants\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ Constructs\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Siege Golems no longer give 10x siege value of the best siege engines in the mod\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ Siege Engines\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Siege Engines are far less useful in Underground terrain and are far more vulnerable there, with more advanced weaponry scaling even more poorly in Caverns compared to simple Mangonels\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ Undead Units\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ There are undead variations of ever\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ Unique Units\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ House Guard\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ The House Guard unit from the ‘Private Army’ Dynasty Perk now counters Monsters and Magi - the Lords of Aeras are sure to hire bodyguards who can protect them from such things!\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Slayers\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ A new Adventurer unit exclusive to the Sjalvolki\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ Slayers are veteran Named Monster Hunters who have gathered into a warband to defeat the most legendary beasts, the cursed dead, or the hated Magi-Slavers\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ Slayers are an upgraded version of the generic Adventurers, with stats far closer to Heavy Infantry along with a boost to Pursuit and Screen, making them difficult to kill in battle and retreat\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ While formidable warriors on their own, they’re downright scary in abnormal terrain, Taiga and Forests (with lesser boosts for most others) with a huge boost to Pursuit to ensure that no beast escapes their hunt (or catches up with them while they get out of dodge)\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ They are also possibly the best (normally) recruitable anti-Specialist unit available with even higher bonuses against Magical, Magi, Undead and Constructs than the standard Adventurer\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ They’re somehow even harder to kill in Winter - god help you\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ They are finally offset by the smallest infantry unit size of any MAA at only 25 and some hefty prices in Gold and Prestige for their services\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Marcher Anti-Magi\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ Anti-Magi are now Adventurers instead of Heavy Infantry\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ Anti-Magi have received a buff to their counters (and the addition of a very small counter to Flying) and a slight malus to their combat stats to help emphasize their Specialist role\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FIVE$ Anti-Magi are also super effective in the Underground and Deadlands like Adventurers\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_FOUR$ Cloudriders are now horse archers\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Changing your Slavery Doctrine now has scaling cost for how large the change is like other Doctrines\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Gurdurbok is now called ‘the Black Mountains’ by default and only Gurdurbok if held by a native Sarridian like Oulnir himself, Maaurrhos for Aversarians\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Changed Sjalvolki names for pre-migration kingdoms in Kalathipsomi in case Cenware fails\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Changed Fogeater title and province localizations to fit their new names\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Mondecny and Drothacny are now spelled Mondekni and Drothakni for aesthetic consistency with their new names\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Many traits will now provide Aspect modifiers though not all\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Reassigned county of Udharaya Dei to an Öltenic holder\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Every spell has had its effects altered or reworked from the ground up for this new system\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Restoring Opakhasia now requires only 3 of its 4 subregions\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Redid province history for Udhaliyah to have far more Ritualist provinces\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Replaced the Gallicads with a heavily assimilated remnant culture to be more lore-accurate\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Significantly increased ruler designer cost for magic traits to reflect their power\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Historical artifacts spawned at start can be rediscovered by adventuring if the originally spawned artifact is destroyed\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ All Bloodline traits have been replaced with unique Dynasty Legacies\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Tightened diplomacy and interaction triggers/restrictions with Liches & other non-human characters in mind\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Non-Sjalvolki tribes of the Imperrech now use their own titles\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ The natives of Kalathipsomi are now all under the Clanlander heritage\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Angobo, Harthah's Manat vassal, now has religious rights\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Chief Magnus of the Praznarva now starts as a Living Magi so he can use the Praznarva’s unique Rituals\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Ruidar’ia description has been altered\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Many Sarradonian titles have had diactrics removed\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Many Marcher, Konijkmener, Lichdoms and Oejeynican provinces have been renamed\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Numerous titles in Mikros Kalathipsomi received generic English names\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Updated and expanded the ‘Kingdom in the Clouds’ decision\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Religious mapmode now displays holy site names instead of the names of the baronies that the holy sites are located in\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Rewrote the Theryionist religious description\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Renamed the Hulawite religious family name to Thursiyyah\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Jarogg ‘Crow-Eye’ is now 65 instead of 45\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Added a hyphen to the ‘Serpent-Speaker’ nickname\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ The ‘Riftsight’ traits will now cancel out most of the effects of the ‘Blind’ trait at the highest levels\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ All faiths have had their Graphical Faith, Piey Icons, Doctrine Background Icons and Hostility Doctrines given a pass over - should be a lot less graphically Christian groups now\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Metropolis Holdings now have increasing Travel Danger modifiers\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Urban Metros increasing per rank 10, 15, 20, 25\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Temple Metros increasing per rank 4, 8, 12, 16\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Trade Metros increasing per rank 4, 8, 12, 16\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ Slave Markets also increase Danger up to 5\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Citadel Metros increasing per rank 3, 6, 9, 12\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Maritime Metros increasing per rank 3, 6, 9, 12\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_THREE$ Pirate Hubs also increase Danger up to 20\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ Ruined Districts have 30 Danger\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Changing your Slavery Doctrine now has scaling cost for how large the change is like other Doctrines\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Islanders will be more likely vassalize to Cenware instead of fight if he has to go through them\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Nicanoneus’ father is now named Ioldon\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Zelkavani culture now has the pacifistic cultural tradition\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Mutsartan now have Mountaineers and Runestones instead of Dexterous Fishermen and Practiced Pirates\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ The descriptions for the Magic faith doctrines no longer specify the first four Magic traits\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Updated and expanded Kardawai holy site migration decisions\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Camera can now be rotated far enough to view the sky at closest zoom levels\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Numerous titles in Mikros Kalathipsomi received generic English names\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Rearranged post-migration de jure empire hierarchy in Kalathipsomi\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Cenware will now destroy Titular titles that he receives from his vassals if they die\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Magic Bones are no longer acquired through a decision-event chain but instead through Adventures and certain travel events\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Edited Kharadamat barony hierarchy for contiguity.\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Updated all existing unique holy site visitation events to use travel mechanics\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Improved Sophocos climbing experience\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Colonization cost has been reworked\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT_TWO$ It will still be expensive, but with an absolute max of 2000 depending on your Arcana and Stewardship\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Makleaxapoli now has Aversarian culture and religion\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Updated the Religious mapmode to display Holy Site names instead of province names\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Updated Faith Sins and Virtues tab for better visual clarity, courtesy of Gael and Jaco_Daan from Co-op\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Updated MAA window to display terrain bonuses in neat rows\n$GH_CHANGELOG_HEADER_MISC$\n$GH_CHANGELOG_BULLET_INDENT$ Spoils of War event’s tooltip was changed a little" #NT!
