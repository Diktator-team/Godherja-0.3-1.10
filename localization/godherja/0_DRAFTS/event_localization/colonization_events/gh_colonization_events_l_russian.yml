 gh_colonization_events.0002.desc: "Recently, the magistrates in charge of my colony in [colony.GetNameNoTier] have been sending increasingly distressing reports about a large band of brigands that has been gaining power in the province. Drawing recruits from disgruntled settlers and opportunistic vagabonds alike, they carry out attacks on merchant caravans and pillage frontier settlements, wreaking havoc on the land and its peoples.\n\nAt the rate their numbers are growing, it would not be long before this wave of banditry spills into the surrounding territories, undermining my authority and control." #NT!

 gh_colonization_events.0003.desc: "A combination of poor harvests, depleted wildlife, and delayed shipments has led to a food shortage in the colony of [colony.GetNameNoTier], with the remaining stores being only barely enough to sustain the local communities for another week or two.\n\nIn the face of the coming crisis, the settlers' representatives have come to me with a desperate plea for assistance, warning that if nothing is done about this looming plight, the province may face widespread starvation and strife." #NT!

 gh_colonization_events.0004.desc: "A [idiot.GetWomanMan] in chains is brought before me by [jailor.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)], falling onto the floor in a heap after a strong push from the latter. With no small amount of surprise, I learn that this person is supposed to be one of the chief administrators of my colony in [colony.GetNameNoTier], accused of deeds that can only be explained by either criminal negligence or complete lunacy.\n\nSupposedly, [idiot.GetSheHe] has almost single-handedly brought the entire community to ruin by wasting supplies, obstructing essential work for the sake holding no fewer than a dozen meetings per day, and levying harsh taxes to fund the construction of a 'Governor's Mansion'.\n\nIf even half of that is true, then it is a mystery how [idiot.GetSheHe] got [idiot.GetHerHis] position in the first place." #NT!

 gh_colonization_events.0005.desc: "A messenger from [colony.GetNameNoTier] has appeared before my court with the most dire news: a horde of monsters has overrun the colony! Driven into a frenzy by the settlers' arrival in the region, the beasts are rampaging through the countryside, devastating hamlets and laying waste to villages. Contact with many settlements has already been lost, and people are only able to get around in large armed groups—if at all.\n\nCasualties are climbing by the day, and, should nothing be done about this calamity, the colony may be destroyed outright." #NT!

 gh_colonization_events.0006.desc: "What an auspicious day!\n\nThe surveyors in [colony.GetNameNoTier] have struck a massive gold vein, commencing the mining operations to fund the growth of the colony and, more importantly, to pay their tribute to me in advance.

 gh_colonization_events.0010.desc: "The colony in [colony.GetNameNoTier] has gone silent.\n\nFirst, it was little things—a scouting party lost to the wilderness, some minor discrepancies in the local census, the odd family searching for their missing child. Then, a fishing vessel went missing. After that, a whole village. And now, not a single message has come from the settlement for over a month.\n\nSeveral vessels were dispatched to investigate the colony and have returned empty-handed, unable to spot even a glimpse of the outpost or its inhabitants. Indeed, even the coastline itself now seems alien and unfamiliar, as if the sheer cliffs of [eripomvuno_biozone|E] have rearranged themselves out of sight.\n\nWith no apparent leads, it seems that whatever became of the missing settlers shall remain a mystery." #NT!
