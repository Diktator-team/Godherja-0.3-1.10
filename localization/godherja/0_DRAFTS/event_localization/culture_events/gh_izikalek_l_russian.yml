 gh_izikalek_events.0002.desc: "Troubling news has reached me from the [desecrated_barony.GetName] – a raiding warband under the command of [raider.GetTitledFirstName] has attacked the settlement in a devastating incursion, ravaging the land and setting the buildings aflame.\n\nNot content with merely burning the village down, [raider.GetHerHis] forces have spent considerable time and effort toppling a minor Herdstone that the settlement had been built around, shattering it and defacing the pieces. I cannot claim to know whether such actions have come out of zealotry, anger that the villagers have narrowly escaped into the surrounding countryside, or even pure malice – what is left for us is to pick up the pieces and rebuild, like we have always done."
