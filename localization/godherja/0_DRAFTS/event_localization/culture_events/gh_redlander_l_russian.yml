 gh_redlander_events.0002.desc: "I am in the midst of sharpening my sacrificial dagger for the offerings I must make to the Dark Gods I serve when I hear a noise behind me. I turn to see an unfamiliar hooded figure approaching me, dragging two bound and beaten captive Redrunners in tow. "Greetings [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetFirstName] [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetDynasty.GetName], my name is [great_commander.GetFirstName]. I bring you new candidates to please our dark masters."\n\nThe dim lighting of [great_commander.GetFirstNamePossessive] torch casts a series of eerie shadows across the dark, towering walls of the canyon around us. Our captives struggle weakly against their bonds as we approach the site of the ritual altar, its hewn jet-black stone stained crimson with dried blood. As I place both captives on the altar, I ponder whether or not two sacrifices will be sufficient to please my dark masters. Perhaps more blood is needed... " #NT!
