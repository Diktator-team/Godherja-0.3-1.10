 sepattan_religion_desc: "The Sepattan (or ‘True Ways’) are a series of similar faiths that all view the outside world as backward. They believe that the twin gods Tarfal and Jerniem created mankind, and gave them dominion over all animals and fruiting plants to nurture and watch over, but never to enslave. \n\n At first, Man followed these commands and prospered, thriving within the great jungle. But a great demon Korlacu tempted the greatest of the clans with power, whispering that by enslaving nature to their will, they could create new lands and beings — becoming like the gods themselves. \n\n This has led to humanity’s banishment from the great jungle, forever barred from salvation, but promised with reconciliation by staying true to the path first taught by the twin gods." #NT!
