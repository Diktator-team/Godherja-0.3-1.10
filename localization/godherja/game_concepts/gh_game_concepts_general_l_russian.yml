Поскольку с тех пор прошли сотни различных способов измерения времени, а время в том виде, в котором его знают современные люди, существовало не всегда (возможно, по-настоящему оно началось только после Годерджа), невозможно точно датировать большую часть истории человечества.\n\nПочти всегда [Concept("aersanon", "Аэрсанон"|E)] создавал мир после нескольких эонов в пустоте, а затем создал человечество, чтобы попытаться создать существ, с которыми можно было бы общаться.

Rebuffed from Aironoi by the Astliks and recovering from the Last Dragon Rebellion, the Aversarians invaded the Marcher colonies in their ever-growing desire to dominate more lands.\n\nThe initial war was hard fought, with Yakub 'Illspeaker' eventually defeated, Marcher  [Concept("antimagi", "антимаги"|E)] wreaked havoc upon the Aversarians using guerilla tactics against the rugged outlands of Kalathipsomi. The initial series of wars only ended in 569 IS, when both sides, thoroughly exhausted and struggling to resist outside threats while dealing with the other agreeing to draw a new border. Aversaria would gain the majority of Kalathipsomi with the Chevaliens retaining the Black Mountains and all lands west of them.\n\nSeveral smaller wars would be fought for the mountains themselves until 631 IS when the [Concept( 'bloodblight', 'Кровавый свет' )|E] wiped out much of Chevalie's nobility and the Marchers withdrew west, Aversarian settlers soon filling their former holdings. The modern border between de-jure Chevalie and Aversaria has remained since."

While many scholars believe that it was simply poor luck, others have suggested that it was in fact a powerful  [Concept("gedeora", "гедеора"|E)] which inflicted poor luck upon [Concept( 'the_continent', 'континент' )|E]\n\nThe Chaos began with the invasion of the [arch_lich|E] Adwaga Adwakampy into Chevalie and the rise of the Aversarian  [Concept( 'lich', 'лич' )|E] Count Themos in eastern Opakhasia. As the two Liches wreaked havoc, especially due to a collapse in Marcher authority and the Aversarian throne being sat on by a mere child, a powerful series of Gederða began tearing Aversarian cities back and forth through the timeline seemingly at random. Further exacerbating this was a large civil war that quickly broke out between the governors of Kalathipsomi and Malcois in the midst of the invasions.\n\nNot long after, the [Concept( 'bloodblight', 'Кровавый свет' )|E] began its rampage across the world from Aversaria. With the southwest weakened from these calamities, the [kartharadd_imperium|E] launched a massive invasion into Aversaria and conquered most of Malcois, only being beaten back after a brutal near fifty years of war which ended with the defeat of the last Kartharaddi army at the Battle of the Riduvian Barrows in 760 IS, marking the end of the Chaos."

Whether they can still be considered human, mutated human, or a form of  [Concept('fogbeasts','туманных тварей')|E] is hotly debated, and little is known about the particulars of their 'culture' or beliefs.\n\nWhat is known is that they were once a series of tribes scattered across the far northeast, and unlike most who die when trapped within the [Concept("fog", "туман"|E)], they instead adapted to it and changed into something different. They now uniformly worship what they call the 'Mistmother', a personification of the fog, who they believe speaks to them through it.\n\nFogeaters themselves have little remains of human sentience, generally little more than gibbering wrecks who have only retained enough sentience to perform raids and ambushes out of the foglands and kill themselves upon capture. Physically, they possess an unnaturally pale skin from which many of their veins and sometimes even organs can be seen through, and unnaturally spindly and ill-proportioned limbs. Their eyes retain multiple colors not seen in other humans as well, including reds, purples, whites and blacks.

While looking similar to humans, they possessed long pointed ears, alien yet exceptionally striking facial features, and shades of skin going from ivory to black to blue.\n\nThe Aelfir's greatest flaw was in their cruelty. Obsessing over their own image and power, the Aelfir regularly brutalized one another and especially humans in attempts to further their own power. Aersanon saw this as a weakness and strove to fix it with a third project, but was stopped by the Godherja and Their apparent death.\n\nThe Aelfir formed multiple empires across the planet before their destruction in the Godherja, from which they reigned for several thousand years with humanity toiling as a brutalized slave caste. After humanity stole their magic and wiped out the race, they have been almost completely forgotten from history. The closest to memory of the Aelfir is from the  [Concept( 'aversarians', 'аверсареанцев' )|E] who worship a pantheon of 'First Men', and the Sjalvolki whose tales of [creatures|E] from the 'Gods Above' contain mentions to Aelfir, though they are considred minor demons and little more than monsters."

Generally this happens due to proximity to magical places of power such as ancient temples, wayline crossings or magical battlefields, but is also found in [Concept( 'magi', 'маги' )|E] who gather excess power. It is not to be confused with ailments resulting from casting spells requiring an excess of power than what the caster possesses, which is normally called [overwhelmation|E].\n\nExposure Sickness normally begins with headaches, fevers, dizziness and vomiting. At higher levels of exposure it can manifest in the bleeding of the eyes and nose, vomiting of blood, hair and skin loss, and the sloughing of skin. [mutations|E] are common at heightened levels, and at the highest levels of exposure, it has been reported that the afflicted can disintegrate, spontaneously combust, melt, or quite literally explode, assuming they do not simply expire."

 game_concept_overwhelmation_desc: "Overwhelmation is the result of [Concept( 'magi', 'маги' )|E] attempting to cast spells in excess of what their bodies are physically capable of. Normally the result of rookie Magi unsure of their own limits, or Magi in moments of life or death desperation, Overwhelmation normally results in painful death. Combustion, disintegration or explosion are the most common results, other times the spell they are attempting to cast may backfire upon them or those around them. A blast of fire may simply ignite the Magi, attempting to crush an enemy's blood may lead to an explosion of the arms, or attempting to heal a grievous wound to the melting of the Magi's nervous system.\n\n [Concept('aversarian','аверсарианского')|E] researchers in the [mayikprolollans|E] predicted that approximately up to a third or more of Magi not from a magically gifted family or of unknown birth will die of Overwhelmation after casting a spell by accident or in trying to discover their powers."

The disease is generally agreed to be magical in nature, though its origins are unknown. Victims normally show traits similar to [exposure_sickness|E], most likely due to the disease itself rapidly increasing the levels of magic within the victim. Victims normally show glowing, pulsing red veins, bleed from the nose, eyes and ears, and will normally expire from blood loss after rapid skin loss. If they survive this, then they normally die from the lining of the lungs collapsing, and their chests filling with blood. Bloodblight spreads most rapidly to Magi, though mundane humans are still prone to it.\n\nThe effects of the Bloodblight outbreak of the Seventh Century were massive and longreaching. In [Concept( 'chevalie', 'Шевалье' )|E], the first High King in a generation along with his entire extended family were wiped out and the Chevaliens forced to withdraw from their last colonies in the Black Mountains. In Aversaria, an entire generation of the nobility were destroyed, leading to mass societal collapse and a near dissolution of the Aautokrata. In Sarradon, the structured and elite magic class, the Sirhad, were almost entirely destroyed. Without the Sirhad to direct and control magic on the continent, the following generation would throw out most established norms and standards from their predecessors, and begin a rapid arms race to discover new horrifying and powerful spells for war. This would eventually lead to the discovery of [selfreplicating_blood_magic|E], and by extension, [Concept("frodbrokna", "фродбокна"|E)]." 
  
 game_concept_selfreplicating_blood_magic: "Self-Replicating Blood Magic" 
 game_concept_selfreplicating_blood_magic_desc: "Self-Replicating Blood Magic is a name for a series of rituals and a spell which is commonly believed to be the most powerful and dangerous spell known to humans. An exceptionally complicated spell, Self-Replicating Blood Magic is only castable by the most powerful of [Concept( 'magi', 'маги' )|E] and normally requires numerous others to assist them.\n\nThe spell detonates the target in a massive pillar of flame, and quickly does the same to anyone within the blast radius and beyond, spreading even further to Magi or others with magical properties. While theoretically it can be contained to a specific radius or group, the spell is extremely difficult to control, and there has never been casted in recorded history without the caster rapidly losing control.\n\nThe spell was thought lost after its discovery and use by the competing [sarradonian|E] Qurati and Almadi Magi cabals, who wiped themselves and nearly all of the continent's Magi out in the blast and brought anarchy across Sarradon for nearly a century after. It was later discovered by Legon-Aautokratir Aeschraes and Aautokratia Axiaothea during the [aversarian_civil_war|E]. While both prepared to cast it, only Aeschraes managed to in time, and ended up killing 80% of Aversaria's Magi, nearly half of the population otherwise, and wiped out millions otherwise across the entirety of the world. The pure magical power of the spell and the suffering it caused would open [the_rift|E] and bring forth [Concept("frodbrokna", "фродбокна"|E)]."

 game_concept_alchemy_desc: "Perhaps the most underestimated arcane art on the Shattered Coast, alchemy nevertheless occupies an important niche in the [magical|E] needs of society across the world. Though normally associated with poisons by the average layperson, a variety of beneficial potions and poultices can usually be found in the apothecaries of well-off nobles, though they rarely come cheap.\n\nIn [aversaria|E], the Konijkmener were the most important supplier of alchemical products, produced from the waters of their fetid, magically-potent swamps. However, while their concoctions may be abundant and affordable, they rarely do true justice to the potential power of alchemy. The potent vials of pure, liquid force from Kathun-Kai, on the other hand, are often able to rival powerful conventional magic, and fetch an accordingly high price.\n\nIt is well known in the west that in the mysterious far-eastern lands of Kathun-Kai that the reverse is true, with Alchemy being seen as the most important of the magical arts. For this reason, Kathuni potions and inventions are often highly desired in the west, though extremely rare due to Imperial concerns of their arts being stolen."

[Concept( 'magi', 'маги' )|E] often travel from afar to these lines to generate power rapidly, and many of the strongest sites of magical power in the world lay along them.\n\nThe two sources for the Waylines are the [tower_wayline|E], coming from the [sea_tower|E], and the [northern_wayline|E], coming from an unknown location deep in the north. The intersections of these two lines are commonly the most magically powerful locations in the world, and are often places of strange phenomena.\n\nWhile modern Magi are mostly in agreement that the two Waylines are indistinguishable in power, many folk tales claim that the Northern Wayline is one of dark magic while the Tower Wayline is one of neutral or good magics."

Dark Necromancy is normally done through the bonding of souls to the long dead - this is most easily done through the same soul that once belonged to the body, but if need be any will do. Dark Necromancers can command legions of the [gh_general_undead|E] using their own life force to bond them to service, and the greatest among Dead Necromancers can even achieve  [Concept("lichdom", "личдом"|E)], a state of eternal life where a [Concept( 'magi', 'маги' )|E] bonds their soul to their own body - and then kills themselves.

 game_concept_sedentary: "Sedentary" 
 game_concept_sedentary_uppercase: "SEDENTARY" 
 game_concept_sedentary_game_desc: "Sedentary creatures practically never leave a small territory that they consider home. Though this means that they are unlikely to chase after attackers after they retreat, it also makes it significantly harder to track them."

 game_concept_fast: "Fast" 
 game_concept_fast_uppercase: "FAST" 
 game_concept_fast_game_desc: "Fast creatures are capable of notable agility and speed, and are hence more likely to be able to flee once push comes to shove - and are nearly impossible to escape from if they are aggravated.

 game_concept_slow_uppercase: "SLOW"

 game_concept_intelligent: "Intelligent" 
 game_concept_intelligent_uppercase: "INTELLIGENT" 
 game_concept_intelligent_game_desc: "Some creatures go well beyond being merely intelligent for an animal, and are simply intelligent - period. They are very possibly sapient and at the intellectual level of a human, or in rare cases, perhaps even higher. Some may even be capable of speech, if they have any interest in dialogue.\n\nWhat this means in practise is that the game is exceptionally difficult to ambush, is far more proficient at ambushing itself, and is far more likely to retreat if it is at a disadvantage compared to the hunter."

 game_concept_cunning: "Cunning" 
 game_concept_cunning_uppercase: "CUNNING" 
 game_concept_cunning_game_desc: "Cunning creatures possess remarkable wit and forethrought, and are more difficult to deceive than the average beast. This means that they are far harder to successfully ambush, are more adept at pulling off ambushes themselves, and will actively take into account the strength of a potential hunter when determining whether to fight or flee."

 game_concept_huge_uppercase: "HUGE" 
 game_concept_huge_game_desc: "Huge game towers over humans, and is likely able to kill with a well placed stomp if need be - presuming they are able to do so, of course. Even if not overtly aggressive, creatures of this size are formidable, but this also means that they are vastly easier to track than normal. Elephants are a good example of game in this category."

 game_concept_elusive: "Elusive" 
 game_concept_elusive_uppercase: "ELUSIVE" 
 game_concept_elusive_game_desc: "Elusive creatures are not only rare, but difficult to track - their trail can seemingly vanish into nothing in a matter of moments, either as a result of generally leaving little in the way of evidence of their activity, or due to their movement being highly erratic and unpredictable."

 game_concept_brazen: "Brazen" 
 game_concept_brazen_uppercase: "BRAZEN" 
 game_concept_brazen_game_desc: "Brazen creatures navigate their environment with utter carelessness and make no effort to conceal their presence. The trails they leave behind are so obvious that even the most novice of hunters can track them with ease."

 game_concept_poisonous: "Poisonous" 
 game_concept_poisonous_uppercase: "POISONOUS" 
 game_concept_poisonous_game_desc: "Some creatures are able to inflict poisons well beyond what the average human can conceivably survive. They are especially dangerous to hunt, as even what initially seems like a superficial flesh wound can end up killing in a matter of minutes as poison consumes the hapless victim's body." 
  
 game_concept_social_game: "Social Game" 
 game_concept_social: "Social" 
 game_concept_social_uppercase: "SOCIAL" 
 game_concept_social_game_desc: "Social creatures tend to live in groups, making them generally easier to track at the cost of combat being far more risky - if they are not ambushed, there is a chance that the hunter will be pursued at the conclusion of a fight, regardless of success. [skittish|E] creatures will never pursue, and [cautious|E] will only pursue if [intelligent|E] to retaliate in the event of one of their own being killed."

 game_concept_emanates_magic_uppercase: "EMANATES MAGIC" 
 game_concept_emanates_magic_game_desc: "Some creatures emanate dangerous amounts of ambient  [Concept("magic", "магия"|E)] into their surroundings. Though this means they are almost trivial to track for [Concept( 'magi', 'маги' )|E], scaling with their skill, it also means that there is a reasonable risk of [exposure_sickness|E] when fighting one."

 game_concept_moonbound_game_desc: "The phases of  [Concept( 'aervalr', 'Аэрвалр' )|E] are a potent source of [Concept("dead_magic", "магия мертвого"|E)] across the world, and it is unsurprising that some creatures' strength waxes and wanes together with  [Concept("aeras", "Аэрас"|E)]' moon.

 ###Religion and Mythology 
  
 game_concept_ebohephai_mythology: "Ebohephai Mythology" 
 game_concept_ebohephai_mythology_desc: "A divergent Öltenic faith from the further east, the Ebohephai worship a vastly different pantheon than the Ölteni, even if there mythologies remain similar. In the Ēboheph-Ölgon (White Ölgon) mythology, the god Arlikhaan was slain by the jealous goddess Aru-men, who desired to usurp the throne of Ēboheph-Ölgon. As he descended to  [Concept("aeras", "Аэрас"|E)] however, Arlikhaan fought Aru-men and her five thousand demon-spirits, subduing them and banishing her to the Mountain of Pain. Due to this, the Ebohephai do not hate the land; instead considering it sacred and burying their people in a type of burial mound known as Kurgans. They give worship to Arlikhaan and his five thousand demon-spirits and one hundred fire gods. His brother, Kogonhay, was given dominion of all under the sky and from him issued forth the race of man." 
 game_concept_pantheon_of_death: "Pantheon Of Death" 
 game_concept_pantheon_of_death_desc: "The main pillar of Daramarjaratan theology is the $game_concept_pantheon_of_death$, the belief that not only does Daramarjaratan rule the underworld of human souls, but they also rule over an underworld of fallen gods (possibly at the most controversial, all of the gods). In the Pantheon of Death, the souls of the other divines remain trapped after their apparent death, and their will can only be known through Daramarjaratan, the interpreter of the dead. Thus, Daramarjaratan is in essense a regent for the throne of the gods, and all claimed interactions with them are actually through Daramarjaratan relaying their messages at her own leisure." 
 game_concept_avastya_mahani_history: "Avastya Mahani Origins" 
 game_concept_avastya_mahani_history_desc: "One of  [Concept("aeras", "Аэрас"|E)]'s oldest faiths and most likely the oldest organized religion in Kashirya, the Avastya Mahani faith is a polytheistic faith that, at least two thousand years before the formation of [aversaria|E], either migrated west from the lands of Dahangon or was inspired by pagan migrants entering Kashirya from the region. While most Avastya Mahani choose one or a handful of gods to focus their worship upon, many cults to specific deities have split from the faith and formed their own offshoot faiths (especially after Kashirya's conquest by Otached's [iorne_horde|E]) such as Saravarawat, god of knowledge whose followers formed Vidvaookeyatranism; and Karhikala, god of war, death and justice whose followers would form Karitkamaicism" 
 game_concept_paerasjatan_old_myth: "Oldest Myth of Paerasjaratan" 
 game_concept_paerasjatan_old_myth_desc: "The oldest myths of the Avastya Mahani, though belief in them is extremely rare, claims that the infinite gods are reflections of Paerasjatan who forged all of them."

 game_concept_varodist_creation_myth: "Varodist Creation Myth" 
 game_concept_varodist_creation_myth_desc: "Varodaists believe that the creation of the world was done through the shifting of water that slowly carved land from rock, and that the holy oceans and seas can portray prophecies within the movement of their waves. They see time as cyclical, believing that the world is in an unending series of being consumed by the sea and destroyed, only for the seas to recede and for the sea creatures to once again wander onto land to repopulate the reformed land.\n\nVarodaists also worship Varoda's children, the aquatic creatures of the sea which they maintain all land creatures descended from; ancient beasts slowly walking on land and shedding their scales." 
 game_concept_aruvas_myth: "Myth of Aruvas" 
 game_concept_aruvas_myth_desc: "Adherents of Aruvasue believe that the world was born when Aruvas, He-Who-Is-One-But-Is-Three, became disunited under the strain of His own power. Aruva Tsere became the sun, Aruva Nilud the moon, and Aruva Agat became the spirit of humankind. They consider each honored guest to be inhabited by the spirit of Aruva Agat, who will speak on their behalf during [oskinjer|E]." 
 game_concept_oskinjer: "Os Kinjer" 
 game_concept_oskinjer_desc: "Os Kinjer (The Last Test) is conducted during death, when the three aspects of Aruvas judge and decide the fate of the deceased; whether they shall meet Aruva Tsere in paradise or be damned to toil in the eternal prison of Aruva Nilud. This ritual also extends to their everyday life when honoring a guest with a great feast." 
 game_concept_rutbay_prophesy: "Prophesy of the Ruth'bay Creed" 
 game_concept_rutbay_prophesy_desc: "The Rut'Bayan creed prophesizes that one day, when the world needs them most, the twelve dissenters will return from Paradise and save the faithful from their sins. Whilst initially a large movement, a lack of support amongst the richest Aruvasueni towns meant that the faith was suppressed quickly. However, while the faith has often been mocked by foreign powers, its influence over the early religion cannot be overstated." 
 game_concept_sword_mother: "Sword Mother of the Sar'muyr" 
 game_concept_sword_mother_desc: "The Sword Mother is said to to be the angelic right hand of Aruva Nilud. It is said that she is the one who is encounters when Os Kinjer is failed, taking the fallen faithful to the realm of her lunar master. Revered across all aruvasuen faiths for her strength and wisdom, she is respected most by the Sar'muyr. They believe that the Sword Mother is Queen of the Dead as Aruva Agat is King of the Living, and are deeply protective of their ability to trace their bloodlines to the original Sar'muyr." 
 game_concept_fate_of_ertomaxism: "Fate of Ertomaxism" 
 game_concept_fate_of_ertomaxism_desc: "While the death of [ertomax|E] at the hands of a nameless assassin was a tragic blow to his bestial followers, it did not outright end the cult-like faith that reigned terror across non-believers in southern Aironoi. Remaining a powerful influence within the overarching Aruvasue fold, his supporters continue to await the day that he will return to resume the purification of the world. Many have been claimed to be the beloved Ertomax, but few have survived long enough to fulfil his legacy." 
 game_concept_armazli_mountains: "Armazli Mountains" 
 game_concept_armazli_mountains_desc: "The Arnazni faithful believe that the Armazli Mountains that protect them from the northern barbarians were made by their ancestors who held godlike magical powers; however, as time went on, these beings started to lose their might due to becoming content and soft. An exception to this were the three brothers; [arnaz_azot_zalden|E]. Disgusted by their peers' new habits, the three of them made a new mountain. Arnaz, being eldest and wisest, was crowned High king. After Parnaz slew Azot in a duel for the high kingship, the  great mountain where his father was crowned would be renamed in his honor, and no foul man or beast may step foot on it." 
 game_concept_arnaz_azot_zalden: "The Arnaz Brothers" 
 game_concept_arnaz_azot_zalden_desc: "Arnaz, Azot and Zalden were three brothers and were said to be one of the many ancestors of the Amagheans that held godlike powers. Disgusted by the increasingly lax and content nature of their fellow peers', the three set out to build a new mountain. Arnaz the Eldest and Wisest was crowned High King and set out on a conquest to unify the land. However, during the wars, his brother Azot became jealous at his success and betrayed him, slaying Arnaz and claiming his throne for himself. Before his death, however, Arnaz cursed everyone leading to a great reduction in magical capabilities. Furthermore, Arnaz proclaimed that his son would kill Azot and reclaim the high kingship\n\nAnd so it was that after many years, a young man named Parnaz, with aid from Zalden, would slay Azot in a duel and reclaim the throne. The great mountain on which his father was crowned would be renamed in his honor, and no foul man or beast may step foot on it. Parnaz would reign for many centuries, and many in Amaghea today would be related to him." 
 game_concept_xaxbaxakanax_esotericism: "Xaxbaxakanax Esotericism" 
 game_concept_xaxbaxakanax_esotericism_desc: "Due to their exceptionally simple set of beliefs compared to other contemporaries, many find their faith extremely esoteric. As such, it is believed(by the Aversarians at least) to be most likely caused by them having been exceptionally primitive and disparate when their few historical realms were consumed by their neighbors. Very few realms have held power over them.\n\nAnd so, when their homelands were conquered by the Aversarians, they saw it as just yet another in a series of petty despots that would always come and always go, and as such, the faithful largely avoided harsh treatment by being too minor to achieve notice" 
 game_concept_evil_lore: "Evil Lore" 
 game_concept_evil_lore_desc: "Askevaryaans describe 'Evil Lore' as the knowledge that entered the world against Sarvat's wishes thanks to the efforts of evil demons and gods. To please Sarvat's wishes and ensure that the world is as they wished, 'Evil Lore' is to be destroyed and wiped out. This has naturally led to Askevaryaans regularly burning down libraries across Kashirya in an attempt to erase remnants of ancient and dark rituals."
