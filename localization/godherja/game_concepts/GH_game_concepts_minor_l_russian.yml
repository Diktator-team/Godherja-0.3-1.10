 game_concept_legio_xxi_desc: "State Legio XXI, often called 'The Aautokratir's Own', historically had the unique honor of being allowed to take the name of the reigning Aautokratir.\n\nNamed 'Aeschraes' during the [imperial_civil_war|E], the Legion would change sides (and names) shortly before [frodbrokna|E] and thereafter refuse to acknowledge a name other than Axiaothea." #NT!
  
 game_concept_imperial_western_faction: "Imperial Western Faction" #NT!
 game_concept_imperial_western_faction_desc: "In late [aversaria|E], the growth of Aironoi as the preeminent Governorate led to political power in the Empire slowly dividing into two increasingly hostile and distant political factions, the Western Faction led by Etepezea (almost always joined by Kalathipsomi) and the Eastern Faction led by Aironoi. This divide would culminate with the [imperial_civil_war|E] in 1186 IS and eventually [frodbrokna|E]." #NT!

 game_concept_first_to_second_empire: "Second Empire" #NT!
 game_concept_first_empire_desc: "[aversarian|E] religious doctrine claims that a great city, ruled by a [magi|E] named the [purest|E], once spanned the entirety of Aeras with its center at the [imperial_tower|E]. This was the 'First Empire', destroyed by invading barbarians (often named the 'Voidspawn') and treacherous slaves in eons long past. Aversarians see the themselves as the reclaimers to this legacy and the modern Aautokrata as the 'Second Empire'." #NT!

 game_concept_thousand_days: "Thousand Days" #NT!
 game_concept_the_thousand_days_of_asiupoli_desc: "While Asiupoli was by far the most prosperous city of [aversaria|E], the final decades of the city's history saw an unprecedented series of disasters both natural and not. Over a period of years, the 'Thousand Days' would see the city face devastating floods, the collapse of the ruins that the lower city had been constructed upon in an earthquake, the unearthing of a hive of creatures known as the 'Ykian' from an ancient temple beneath the Governorial Palace, and more.\n\nThe collapse would culminate in the [imperial_civil_war|E] where mass bread riots and a horrific plague epidemic were answered by Aautokratia Axiaothea with the extermination of much of the populace. The city was already largely a wasteland by the time [selfreplicating_blood_magic|E] finally wiped the remains from [aeras|E]." #NT!
