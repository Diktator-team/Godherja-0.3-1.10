 gh_journey_event.0002.elysia_aversarian_young_legionnaire.desc: "#F\"Wasn’t that long ago, was it? I was with the Eighth, Enortax. ‘Unity’ in the old dialect. So much for that, eh? We were the ones the Sjalvolki hit first, before the Pass. To the east on the Maklean Highway. Told us we were just going to reinforce Fort Larhka, Sjalvolki wouldn’t be able to break the fort for months. Some truth that was! We were halfway through the march, not even in armor, when the horde hit us straight in the chest.\n\nSome battle. Lasted a few hours at most and then the pride of Aversaria was running with our tails between our legs like hell was behind us. Guess it really was. Took our Legan, held her up in front of all of us before her daddy in the Nineteenth charged out. Saw it while we were trying to form back up with the rest. They let us for some reason, let us get right back into formation right in time for the [fog|E].\n\nI was young. Still am. Fast on my foot. They used to say I was the fastest kid in the Legion. All of us bolted, and I was the first to break out of that mess. Few guys… not enough… but a few of the men were with me. We ran to the closest village, dropped off our armor, and not one of us picked up a sword again...\"#" #NT!
 gh_journey_event.0002.elysia_aversarian_young_cavalry.desc: "#F\"Were you at the Pass? No? Shame, not many of us around open to talkin’ about it. I get it, I do. Always felt talkin’ about it made it better though, might just be me. Can’t really think about how folks think about it all the time without sayin’ nothing. It’s even like a cuss back home in [Aversarian Barony]. You say Elysia at the market and everyone stops and stares.\n\nWas in the cavalry. 43rd Legion. One of the Noble ones, so wasn’t super fancy. Was the youngest rider though, pride of the village when Legon Mechres saw me ridin’ and said he wanted me in the Legion. Proud myself. Still am, I guess.\n\nI know what they say. Sjalvolki used [fog|E] an’ that did us in. Don’t believe it though. Don’t agree. I saw it from the top of the horse, an’ we were at the top of the hill, the one on the left of the Pass meanin’. Facing the Sjalvolki that is… the Issoroc I think? Anyway, I saw it good an’ well. Never had a chance we did. Legions were already backing up when the Sjalvolki showed. Always a bad sign when the line backs up. Meanin’ they’re scared. Kept with the Legion after, even with Mechres dead and half us scattered. Every time we lost, I’d see it again. Nobody wins a fight they’re so scared to get in.\"#" #NT!
