 patron_saint_event.0201.desc: "When working in emulation of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], one must at some point take action beyond belief and prayer. Of course, given my day to day duties as an administrator of my realm I can hardly afford to take on the work of a physician full time, so I must direct my endeavors narrowly. Dedicating my efforts as a healer to the sick and wounded in my realm is always the obvious and effective option. Alternatively I could spend my time spreading teachings and medical knowledge of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HealthGodName] to the masses. Of course, I could always just build another hospital." #NT!

I wonder to myself if I'm cut out for this life.\n\nSoon I find myself looking at an empty clinic, the air thick with the smell of blood and illness, the scrubbed floors sticky with viscera and discarded bandages. No doctor can save everyone, but I can take solace in knowing that at least a few lives were spared by my actions here.

To a few who seem particularly gifted I try and explain how to clean and treat wounds. Annoyingly, a few of these discussions turn into heated arguments, with Thysian learning pitted against the dogmatic superstitions of the peasantry.
