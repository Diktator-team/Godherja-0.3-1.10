Upon the beginning of the Rebellions he would beg the commander of his legion to allow him leave to aid the slaves. To his surprise, Legan Sansia instead declared the Legion would march there with him, and the Rebellions began soon after. The burning sword of Saint Eos is held true by those who dedicate themselves to martial perfection and the protection of the weak." #NT!

Renowned for her beauty and wit, the 'Rose of the Legions' would cement her fame by marching her legions to defend freed slaves from the Opakhasian Governorial Legions in the Battle of Plateira, beginning the Agionist rebellions. Sansia believed that a general must not only be a master of warfare, but a model of virtue for their soldiers and those they protect." #NT!

She would gain the love of Aautokratir Phancis which many believe to be the ultimate reason most of the Saints would survive their rebellion, but would become martyred not long after. For centuries hence her name has been called upon for good health and fortune by the descendents of her thankful patients, and the Thysian Code remains one of the most comprehensive medical charters on [the_continent|E]." #NT!

 forgotten_pure_patron_saint_name: "The Forgotten Saint" #NT!
 forgotten_pure_patron_saint_desc: "The most mysterious and illusive of the Agionist Saints, the Forgotten Saint was allegedly a monk of the Scarlet Chosen of the Vounill who struck out along with a small clique of other monks after forming an extremist faction within the Mountain-Sun. The Forgotten Saint targeted the [magi|E] as a political class and challenged the concept of 'Divine Reincarnation' of the Aautokratirs, claiming that the worship of Magi and their powers were a rot upon the world that had to be excised. To show humility and reject the idolatry of the Empire is to show faith and piety, for all men and women are equal, and the destruction of the false separations between humanity is the only path to collective salvation." #NT!

 calysto_pure_patron_saint_desc: "A famed pirate captain and liberator of slaves, Calysto was born into a small fishing village in the southeastern isles. Taken as a galley slave first by pirates, and later by the Marine Legions of Aversaria, Calysto successfully lead a slave mutiny to establish his own pirate fleet. Sailing accross all of [aversaria|E], Saint Calysto would raid slave markets and plantations, freeing the slaves and starting rebellions in his wake, for he believed that nothing was worth more than freedom." #NT!

 sansia_corrupt_patron_saint_desc: "Sansia the Conqueror embodied the strength of [aversaria|E] by becoming a powerful Arch-Legan that was feared across the continent. Renowned for her skill in battle, she would cement her fame by defeating the Opakhasian Governorial Legions in the Battle of Plateria, where she slaughtered them to the last. Sansia believed that a general must master both warfare and fear and that it is only through suffering, sacrifice, and pain that people become closer to the Purest. Therefore, to bring salvation for the heathens’ souls and safeguard the Orders, we must practice the craft not only on our enemies, but even ourselves." #NT!

 dikaynos_corrupt_patron_saint_desc: "Dikaynos was a merciless crusader in the name of justice, never once allowing empathy or sensitivity to cloud his judgment. We, too, must not let our own human weakness obstruct our relentless war against disorder, for the law is both blind and pitiless.!" #NT!

 katharitos_corrupt_patron_saint_desc: "Katharitos would travel the world and speak extensively of the purety of the heart, mind and body.

 thysia_corrupt_patron_saint_desc: "Thysia believed that medical knowledge must be saved and expanded upon, and dreamed of a world where those deserving of the title of physician would know the cures for all diseases and poisons. It is only natural then that those who follow the great Saint do anything in their power to learn of the body and its ailments. #N Anything#!." #NT!
 philanthros_corrupt_patron_saint_name: "Philanthros the Shrewd" #NT!
 philanthros_corrupt_patron_saint_desc: "Philantros saw the poor and needy suffer under the [aversarian|E] aristocracy and endeavored to help them by collecting donations. Yet the desert heathens cannot see this and refuse to provide what is due to the saint’s own chosen. For in these current times, who is more in need than the Order, the most noble and devoted followers of Philantros? It is our tireless duty to use these offerings to aid those that most deserve it - ourselves. So, bring out the wine and the finest food. Let us dine like the nobility of Opakhasia!" #NT!
 forgotten_corrupt_patron_saint_name: "The Forgotten Saint" #NT!
 forgotten_corrupt_patron_saint_desc: "A being of power and might, the Forgotten Saint descended from the holy Vounill as a mythic figure, unidentifiable and eclipsing the power of the petty Aautokratirs who They proved were naught but pretenders to Their own vaunted divinity. In the Rebellions, the Forgotten Saint's holiest followers proved the most zealous and holy, showing Them their allegiance with a sacrifice to destroy the Purest's false-reincarnation by slaughtering the devilish children of Aautokratir Phancis in the Forgotten One's holy name. Their followers mask themselves still, imitating their glory, and paying Them worship in memory of their ascent to divinity upon the destruction and sacrifice of so many weaker gods." #NT!

 calysto_corrupt_patron_saint_desc: "A famed pirate captain and liberator of slaves, Calysto seized power from humble origins. He sailed across all of [aversaria|E], raiding slave markets, plantations and mansions for all their riches and slaves. He freed the needy by enslaving them in this life to serve us, so in their next life they will be true believers. In this way, he gave us all the most important things, freedom." #NT!
